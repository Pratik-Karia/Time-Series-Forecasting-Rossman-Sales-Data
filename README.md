## Time Series Forecasting Rossman Sales using Machine Learning

The research objective was to determine which models best fit the time series data, which would help organisations take measurable steps to improve their revenue and sales, not only provide financial assistance but also help businesses manage their inventory so they are never out of stock of any product, prevent overstocking, which would result in throwing away the products, incurring loss to the company, and reach their targeted sales to grow business.
As a part-time employee at one of the retail stores, I am aware of how various factors influence sales, thus for this study, I used the Rossmann store dataset, which takes into account all of the variables required to determine their impact on sales. 

### Objective 1: is to investigate various effects such as whether or not a promotion is available in the store, whether or not there is a state or public holiday, whether or not there are any competitors stores nearby and, if so, how far are they from the Rossmann store and how long have they been open, what day of the week because sales are typically higher on Sundays, and which month of the year because December has the highest sales due to Christmas. 

### Objective 2: is Implementing different machine learning models to forecast sales with higher accuracy.

### About the Rossman Store Dataset:
• The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com. Link for the Kaggle Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales
• The dataset contains historical sales information for 1,115 Rossmann locations. It has three different datasets: training dataset, Store dataset and Test dataset.
• Training dataset: which contains information about whether that particular store was open or not, how much sales were made on that particular day of that particular month, and how many customers came to that particular store.
• Store dataset: which contains information about the type of store in a different location, what assortment is in that store, whether the promotion is applied in that store, and whether any competition exists.
• Test dataset: Test datasets contain the same variables as the training dataset but without the Sales variable, but they are used to validate our model's accuracy. 
• This dataset was part of a $35,000 Feature Prediction Competition on Kaggle.com.
